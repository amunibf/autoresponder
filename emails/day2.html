Subject: My dog peed on my ex's shoes. Here's what I learned {name}

Body:

Hey {name}, fellow dog-wrangler!

So the other day, I came home to find my dog proudly sitting next to a very wet pair of shoes. Not just any shoes â€” my exâ€™s. Coincidence? I think not.

But hereâ€™s the thingâ€¦ it made me realize something important:

ðŸ‘‰ Dogs donâ€™t come with a manual.
They come with chaos, zoomies, and an uncanny talent for ignoring every command â€” especially when you're late for work.

So today, I wanna share 3 quick training truths (learned the hard way, usually with poop involved):

1. "Sit" only works if you have a treat. Or a steak. Or a squirrel.
Dogs are highly motivated by snacks. Use that to your advantage. Training = bribery, and I support it 100%.

2. House training is like dating.
Thereâ€™s a lot of confusion, poor communication, and someoneâ€™s always left cleaning up a mess.
Consistency is key. And no, yelling "WHY?!" doesnâ€™t work. I tried.

3. Leash pulling? Congrats, youâ€™re now a human sled.
Your dog isnâ€™t trying to ruin your life â€” they just think you walk too slow.
Try stopping every time they pull. Theyâ€™ll eventually realize walkies arenâ€™t a race. (Unless they see a squirrel. Then Godspeed.)

Training a dog is hard, hilarious, and 100% worth it.
Stay patient. Stay positive. And for the love of tennis balls, keep the shoes out of reach.
